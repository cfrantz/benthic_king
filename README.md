# Benthic King: A Zelda II ROM Hack

_Benthic King_ was a Zelda II ROM Hack created for the _Zelda II Speedruns
Discord's_ [Hackjam 2020](https://eab.xyz/hackjam) event, in which a
number of participants created small RomHacks over the course of a week.

Although [Z2Edit](https://github.com/cfrantz/z2edit) is one of the more
complete ROM Hacking tools available, it has a number of shortfalls.
Most importantly, _Z2Edit_ is not a good tool for collaboration, as BGT
and I discovered.  This motivated me to re-write _Z2Edit_ from scratch
with collaboration as a specific goal.

This repository is a Z2Edit-2.0 project which re-creates _Benthic King_.

## Story

```
Hyrule has enjoyed years
of uncharacteristic peace.

Bagu spends all his days
endlessly fishing, but now
he has angered the king of
the merfolk.  The oceans
are rising quickly.  Link
must journey into the
briny depths and defeat
the fish king in his most
adventuresome quest yet...
```
